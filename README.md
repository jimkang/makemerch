The functor, `MakeMerch`, requires an opts object with a `wordnikAPIKey` whose value is your [Wordnik API key](http://developer.wordnik.com/) and a `request` function, which can be from the [request](https://github.com/request/request) module or anything that behaves like it and make http requests.

The function that it generates, `makeMerch` takes the number of items to be generated and a callback which will be passed the error and the items.
